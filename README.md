# 🐍 Snake Game (Python)

This is a classic **Snake Game** built using **Python** and **Pygame**. The game allows players to control a snake, eat food to grow longer, and avoid collisions with the walls and itself.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Classic Snake gameplay  
✅ Simple and smooth controls  
✅ Score tracking  
✅ Custom game icon (`icon.ico`)  

## 🛑 Possible Issues with Executable file  

The game was compiled using **PyInstaller**, but some antivirus programs may falsely detect the .exe as a trojan or malware.

This is a common issue with PyInstaller because it packages the Python interpreter along with the script, which some security programs flag as suspicious.

This is a well-documented false-positive issue, but if you have any concerns, feel free to check it out (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=PyInstaller+.EXE+Detected+as+Virus%3F&sca_esv=bc494ed727a50377&rlz=1C1CHZN_enID1025ID1025&sxsrf=AHTn8zqHSDgqQb8CcDXqNiYPxVPpAqZ0Ww%3A1739438055812&ei=57etZ_GPMd-94-EPl4KHmQw&ved=0ahUKEwixn7Pbp8CLAxXf3jgGHRfBIcMQ4dUDCBA&oq=PyInstaller+.EXE+Detected+as+Virus%3F&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiI1B5SW5zdGFsbGVyIC5FWEUgRGV0ZWN0ZWQgYXMgVmlydXM_MgYQABgWGB5IzhFQgAVYgAVwA3gAkAEAmAGmAaABoAKqAQMwLjK4AQzIAQD4AQL4AQGYAgSgAtcBwgIKEAAYsAMY1gQYR5gDAOIDBRIBMSBAiAYBkAYIkgcDMy4xoAfeBQ&sclient=gws-wiz-serp">PyInstaller .EXE Detected as Virus?</a>).
