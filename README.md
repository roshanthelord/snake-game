# 🐍 Snake Game (Python)

This is a classic **Snake Game** built using **Python** and **Pygame**. The game allows players to control a snake, eat food to grow longer, and avoid collisions with the walls and itself.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Classic Snake gameplay  
✅ Simple and smooth controls  
✅ Score tracking  
✅ Custom game icon (`icon.ico`)  
✅ Compiled to **EXE** using **PyInstaller**  

## 🛠️ Installation  
1. Install **Python** (if not already installed)  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Run the game:  
   ```bash
   python myscript.py
   ```

## 🏗️ Compiling to EXE  
I used **PyInstaller** to convert the Python script into an EXE file with the following command:  
```bash
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --icon="icon.ico" --name=game myscript.py
```
However, every time I try to compile it, the resulting **EXE** is detected as **malicious** or **a Trojan** by some antivirus programs.  

## ⚠️ False Positive Issue  
This is a known issue with **PyInstaller**, as some antivirus programs flag EXE files created with it as potential threats. Possible workarounds:  
- **Sign the EXE** with a valid certificate  
- **Use a different PyInstaller version**  
- **Exclude the EXE from antivirus scans** (if safe)  
- **Use UPX exclusion** by adding `--noupx` to the command
